  <title>Tarun Motwani — Building Impact with Code</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Driven by Code. Defined by Purpose.</h1>
  
  <p>
    I’m <strong>Tarun Motwani</strong> — a committed learner and aspiring full-stack developer, dedicated to solving real-world problems through technology.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This isn’t just a portfolio. It’s the starting point of a disciplined journey — one focused on continuous growth, delivering value, and creating lasting impact in the tech ecosystem.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I believe in learning by building, in earning by serving, and in growing by giving back.  
    This page marks Day 1 of a long-term commitment — not just to code, but to mastery and meaningful work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s build the future — with humility, hard work, and high standards.
